## GNS3 VS EVE-NG VS PACKET TRACER VS VIRL VS ENSP: A COMPREHENSIVE COMPARISON

### INTRODUCTION:

Gone are the days when network engineers had to rely on physical routers, switches, and firewalls to design, test, and troubleshoot their networks. Thanks to network emulation and simulation technology advancements, we now have various tools to create virtual network environments that behave like real networks. When I took my CCIE 15 years ago, I needed to invest in many routers and switches, which cost a lot and were difficult to get. Not to mention the network rack, cable, cooling and the noise I must bear when I practice near the lab pod. However, this is not the case now and with so many simulators available, choosing the right one for your needs can be daunting. This article compares and contrasts five of the most popular network emulation and simulation tools: GNS3, EVE-NG, Cisco Packet Tracer, VIRL, and eNSP.
