### What Is a Network Engineer?

Network engineers (also called network architects) plan, construct and manage networks to ensure they’re optimized and functioning as intended.

As a network engineer, you’re responsible for the foundation of an organization’s IT system (and by default, the entire organization).

While network technicians or IT administrators assist with daily IT and troubleshooting tasks, network engineers take on the high-level challenge of designing and improving networks.

Depending on the company, you’ll be creating and implementing physical and wireless networks, troubleshooting issues and researching and integrating new technologies.
