In laymanâ€™s terms, a VPN uses encryption to create a private online connection between a device and a VPN server. With a good VPN service, you can shield your data from curious eyes.

A VPN protocol is the set of rules that shapes how your data travels between your computer, mobile phone, tablet, or any other device, and a VPN server. The type of VPN protocol that you use can affect the speed, stability, ease of use, security, and privacy of your connection.

WireGuard is the newest player in the VPN protocol world and has many advantages over older types of protocols. Many experts are excited about WireGuard because it trims the fat to be faster and lighter than protocols like OpenVPN. For example, WireGuard has less than 4000 lines of code while other protocols have hundreds of thousands of lines. However, like any cutting-edge technology, the protocol also has some areas to improve.
