- After finish the initial setup, If you want to use Online Mode you need to check the connection to internet.

> - To check internet connection run commands: ping pnetlab.com; ping user.pnetlab.com, ping uploader.pnetlab.com, ping docker.io
> - In case you can not ping to internet, please try:
>   - Reset network adapter of virtualization platform **(Vmware: Edit > Virtual network Editor > Restore Default)**
>   - Disable then enable virtual network card on your window **(Vmware: vmnet 1 and vmnet 8)**
>   - Use only one virtualization platform **(Vmware: uninstall virtualbox or hyper-v)**
