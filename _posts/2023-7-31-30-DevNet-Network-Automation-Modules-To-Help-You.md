# 30 DevNet Network Automation Modules To Help You

Everyone is talking about Cisco’s new Devnet platform and certification track. But who is it for? I have received a ton of messages asking how does it apply to network engineers? 

Is it just for developers? 

If not, then where do I start?

If you have not already, check out my interview with Cisco DevNet CTO and Founder Susie Wee. In this video Susie covers everything you need to know about DevNet. 

In this post I am going to share with you 30 modules that are freely available on Cisco’s Devnet platform that you can begin using right now. To not only educate yourself on network automation. You have the opportunity to learn skills that no other platform is offering for free. In this list you will learn everything from Python, Git, APIs, ACI, Kubernetes, SD-WAN and more. There are over one hundred modules on the platform and I have been through them all in depth. 

Quick note. In some of the modules you will need a vpn connection into Devnet. For many of the labs you won't need it. Here's a link to download [anyconnect](https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/anyconnect/).

**1.** **Networking Basics** 

**–** *Duration 1 Hour 20 minutes*

Before we even get started with network automation, we have to know the basics of networking. If you are brand new to networking this is ground zero. This module breaks down networking basics, topologies, and ip addressing. The module is not that long, so you will have to continue to build on this knowledge if you are just starting out. https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/networking-basics

**2.** **Developer Workstation and Environment Setup** 

**–** *Duration 3 Hours*

This module focuses on helping you setup your computer or laptop for devnet. You will go through why you need a developer environment along with explaining tools like IDE, version control, and shells. If you are brand new to automation but already have a grasp on networking, I would start here.

**3.** **Python Fundamentals** 

**–** *Duration 2 Hours 15 Minutes*

Python is the most popular network automation language right now. This module focuses on teaching you the fundamentals python, APIs, JSON, and git for version control as well. Here will be the core of your beginner skills that you will be building on. The more you practice, the better you will git! https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/intro-python

**4.** **LM-4402: REST APIs** 

**–** *Duration 1 Hour 55 Minutes*

The previous module touches on APIs (Application Programming Interface) and this module dives even deeper while introducing us to postman. You will enjoy this module because you get to parse data from an actual WebEx API. Enjoy! https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/devnet-express-np-rest-python

**5.** **Network Programmability** 

**–** *Duration 2 Hour 20 Minutes*

You may ask why this was not listed sooner. But we had to cover some of the fundamentals before we start diving deeper. In this module you will learn about Network Programmability and all of its intricacies. https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/network-programmability

**6.** **Introduction to Model Driven Programmability** 

**–** *Duration 1 Hour 30 Minutes*

Now its time to get out of our comfort zone and explore NETCONF and RESTCONF to communicate with Cisco XE IOS devices. I am not a real fan of NETCONF, because I prefer JSON over XML and YANG. Either way you will learn and enjoy this module. 

https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/intro-device-level-interfaces

**7.** **Cloud Native Development** 

**–** *Duration 1 Hour 50 Minutes*

It’s odd that we are talking about microservices before we talk about virtualization. Either way this module will introduce you to the world of Docker Containers. Which has become the way of future. As you develop your scripts and apps you will need a location to host them. Rather than using your personal computer or taking up resources on a server you can create a container that performs your single task or a series of tasks.

https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/cloud-native-development

**8.** **Introduction to Ansible** 

**–** *Duration 1 Hour 5 Minutes*

My goal with this post is to share resources that you can use to improve your skills. To be honest I see a future where knowing a coding language will not be as necessary. And this is because of tools like Ansible. This tool makes automation seems so simple.

https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/sdx-ansible-intro

**9.** **Cisco SD-WAN** 

**–** *Duration 2 Hours 5 Minutes*

If we are preparing for the future then knowing about the latest technologies is a must. This module will introduce you to Software Defined Wide Area Networking. I know it’s a big term that can have some even bigger implications if you misconfigure it.

https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/sd-wan

**10.** **DevOps** 

**–** *Duration 4 Hours 45 Minutes*

This module goes over some of the moving pieces in DevOps. It focuses on CI/CD/CD which is continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment.

https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/devops

**11.** **Introduction to NetDevOps Configuration Pipelines with CICD** 

**–** *Duration 1 Hour 5 Minutes*

Continuing on with the DevOps theme this module will walk you through building your own CICD pipeline. This is a must if you are making changes to your code. You will need to know if there are issues before your push code out to production.

https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/netcicd

**12.** **Vagrant Up for Network Engineers**

**–** *Duration 2 Hours 5 Minutes*

If you are going to be working in virtual environments and with containers. Vagrant is an opensource tool that helps you simplify this process. This module will walk you through the process of using Vagrant to build out your test virtual environments.

**13.** **NETCONF/YANG on Nexus** 

**–** *Duration 1 Hour 10 Minutes*

Next to Json my next favorite data model is yang. Its readable and makes sense. This module walks you through the process of using yang data models and NxOS. https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/netconf-yang-nexus

**14.** **Introduction to ACI Programmability** 

**–** *Duration 1 Hour 40 Minutes*

In this video I discuss 5 technologies that you should be learning right now and aci is one of them. Not to be bias but I think ACI is the coolest technology in networking today. There is so much to learn and we are at the beginning of its implementation. For the next few modules we will focus on learning about aci. Then learning how to automate it by using tools like the ACItoolkit, Arya, and Cobra. I think you will enjoy this module.

https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/intro-to-aci

**15.** **Intermediate ACI Programmability**

**–** *Duration 3 Hours*

This module will introduce more tools that will expand your aci automation knowledge. I personally had to break this module up into smaller sessions just so I could setup and really grasp the power of WebArya. https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/intermediate-aci-prog

**16.** **Introduction to ACI and Ansible**

**–** *Duration* *1 Hour*

Previous at number 8 we introduced you to ansible. Now its time to take that knowledge and apply it to automating ACI. I like ansible for the simplicity and the ease of use. In this module you will see why. 

https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/ansible-aci-intro

**17.** **Introduction to NX-OS Programmability** 

**–** *Duration* *1 Hour*

**20.** **Introduction to Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) APIs - V-1.1** 

**–** *Duration* *1 Hour*

If you know me then you know my other favorite technology besides ACI is Cisco’s ISE. With ISE replacing ACS and managing all things NAC this module is one I really recommend. It starts with a quick intro ACI and then from there you learn to use the API. The real value in this lab, like in most is the free access you get from live technology.

https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/ise-v11

**21.** **Network Controllers**

**–** *Duration 1 Hour 30 Minutes*

I have been in many organizations and working on ASRs and CSRs and until recently have I realized the true power they hold. In this module you will learn about IOS-XR and how you can automate with Linux and python directly on box. It can be noted that TCLsh has been around for a long time. 

https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/iosxr-cli-automation

**23.** **IOS-XR Streaming Telemetry** 

**–** *Duration 3 Hours*

This module’s description starts off by stating SNMP is dead. That statement alone made me excited to dive into this lab!
