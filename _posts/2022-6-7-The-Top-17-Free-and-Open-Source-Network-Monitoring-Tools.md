#### **Solutions Review lists the best free and open-source network monitoring tools for businesses of all sizes to consider.**

Choosing the right [network monitoring solution](https://solutionsreview.com/network-monitoring/why-do-companies-need-network-monitoring-tools/) for your enterprise is not easy. IT professionals and decision-makers need to consider several factors when choosing solutions for their business, such as security, compatibility, ease of use, and (of course) budget. Enterprise-grade tech solutions are typically viewed as expensive, but is that always the case? Not necessarily! There are several free and open source network monitoring tools that your business should consider when choosing a network monitoring solution.

That’s why we at [Solutions Review](https://solutionsreview.com/network-monitoring/) have compiled a list of the best 17 free and open source network monitoring tools. These tools are either free to install and use, or released under an open source license. They should definitely be considered if your enterprise wants to keep costs down, but we should note that they may not be the best fit for your company. Many free tools are trimmed-down versions of a fully-equipped network monitoring program, and a lot of open source developments require technical knowledge or developer expertise. As such, we’ve listed some of the major features of each free and open source tool so you know what each solution specializes in.
