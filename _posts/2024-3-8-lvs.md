Linux Virtual Server (LVS) is a highly available and highly scalable  virtual server that is built on a cluster of actual servers using a load balancer. This approach allows the service that is being provided to  appear as a single Linux server. In this hands-on lab, you are tasked  with setting up LVS in order to provide a virtual service for two Apache HTTP servers.

## Table of Contents

1. Challenge

   ### Load the IPVS kernel module.

   Load in the IPVS kernel module.

2. Challenge

   ### Install the IPVS administration utility package.

   Use `yum` to install the IPVS administration package.

3. Challenge

   ### Enable packet forwarding and non-local IP address binding.

   Add the IP forward and IP nonlocal bind directives to `/etc/sysctl.conf`.

4. Challenge

   ### Start up the `ipvsadm` service and ensure that it persists through reboot.

   Create the `ipvsadm` configuration file and enable and start the `ipvsadm` service.

5. Challenge

   ### Configure the virtual service and specify the scheduling algorithm.

   Add the virtual service and specify the scheduling algorithm.

6. Challenge

   ### Add the real servers to the virtual service and specify a packet forwarding method.

   Add `real-server1` and `real-server2` to the virtual service.
